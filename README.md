# Final-Project-Data-Science-2022
This is the final project the creates data visulisations of the change in gdp, life expectancy, and the birthrate of a large sampling of countries.
This package works in with the "nations.csv" file and the 2016 gdp census data for countries of most regions in the world. As this is my first project it isn't of the best quality '
however, I will be working extensively on it so that it is more useful to people who are intrigued by this type of data analysis.
